# NOTE: The comments in this file are for instruction and documentation.
# They're not meant to appear with your final, production ebuild.  Please
# remember to remove them before submitting or committing your ebuild.  That
# doesn't mean you can't add your own comments though.

# The 'Header' on the third line should just be left alone.  When your ebuild
# will be committed to cvs, the details on that line will be automatically
# generated to contain the correct data.

# The EAPI variable tells the ebuild format in use.
# Defaults to 0 if not specified. The current PMS draft contains details on
# a proposed EAPI=0 definition but is not finalized yet.
# Eclasses will test for this variable if they need to use EAPI > 0 features.
# Ebuilds should not define EAPI > 0 unless they absolutely need to use
# features added in that version.
#EAPI=0

# inherit lists eclasses to inherit functions from. Almost all ebuilds should
# inherit eutils, as a large amount of important functionality has been
# moved there. For example, the $(get_libdir) mentioned below wont work
# without the following line:
inherit eutils
# A well-used example of an eclass function that needs eutils is epatch. If
# your source needs patches applied, it's suggested to put your patch in the
# 'files' directory and use:
#
#   epatch ${FILESDIR}/patch-name-here
#
# eclasses tend to list descriptions of how to use their functions properly.
# take a look at /usr/portage/eclasses/ for more examples.

# Short one-line description of this package.

src_compile() {
	# Most open-source packages use GNU autoconf for configuration.
	# The quickest (and preferred) way of running configure is:
	econf || die "econf failed"
	#
	# You could use something similar to the following lines to
	# configure your package before compilation.  The "|| die" portion
	# at the end will stop the build process if the command fails.
	# You should use this at the end of critical commands in the build
	# process.  (Hint: Most commands are critical, that is, the build
	# process should abort if they aren't successful.)
	#./configure \
	#	--host=${CHOST} \
	#	--prefix=/usr \
	#	--infodir=/usr/share/info \
	#	--mandir=/usr/share/man || die "./configure failed"
	# Note the use of --infodir and --mandir, above. This is to make
	# this package FHS 2.2-compliant.  For more information, see
	#   http://www.pathname.com/fhs/

	# emake (previously known as pmake) is a script that calls the
	# standard GNU make with parallel building options for speedier
	# builds (especially on SMP systems).  Try emake first.  It might
	# not work for some packages, because some makefiles have bugs
	# related to parallelism, in these cases, use emake -j1 to limit
	# make to a single process.  The -j1 is a visual clue to others
	# that the makefiles have bugs that have been worked around.
	emake || die "emake failed"
}

src_install() {
	# You must *personally verify* that this trick doesn't install
	# anything outside of DESTDIR; do this by reading and
	# understanding the install part of the Makefiles.
	# This is the preferred way to install.
	emake DESTDIR="${D}" install || die "emake install failed"

	# When you hit a failure with emake, do not just use make. It is
	# better to fix the Makefiles to allow proper parallelization.
	# If you fail with that, use "emake -j1", it's still better than make.

	# For Makefiles that don't make proper use of DESTDIR, setting
	# prefix is often an alternative.  However if you do this, then
	# you also need to specify mandir and infodir, since they were
	# passed to ./configure as absolute paths (overriding the prefix
	# setting).
	#emake \
	#	prefix="${D}"/usr \
	#	mandir="${D}"/usr/share/man \
	#	infodir="${D}"/usr/share/info \
	#	libdir="${D}"/usr/$(get_libdir) \
	#	install || die "emake install failed"
	# Again, verify the Makefiles!  We don't want anything falling
	# outside of ${D}.

	# The portage shortcut to the above command is simply:
	#
	#einstall || die "einstall failed"
}
