# HTML provides helper functions to create html pages.
#
# All functions return a string. Under normal circumstances all pages
# should be constructed with the help of Html.base.
#
#==Example
# HTML.base(HTML.h1("heading")+HTML.list(["one", "two", "three"])
# will create a html page with a heading and a list.
module HTML

	# Returns a full html page. content must be a string which
	# will be embedded into the page.
	def HTML.base(content)
		["<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\"><html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><head><title>available files</title></head><body>#{content}#{HTML.hr}#{HTML.div("Delivired by sendhttp #{$version}. sendhttp is licensed under the #{HTML.a("AGPLv3", "/?license")}.

	# Returns a html h1 heading with text as text.
	def HTML.h1(text)

	# Returns a html list, with the elements from the array list.
	def HTML.list(list)
		"<ul>#{list.collect { |l| "<li>#{l}</li>" }.join}</ul>"

	# the address, the link point's to.
